      Derek <strong>"Del Boy"</strong> Trotter (played by David Jason), a South London "fly"
      trader, lives in a council flat in a high-rise tower block, Nelson Mandela
      House, in Peckham, South London, with his much younger brother, Rodney
      (Nicholas Lyndhurst), and their elderly grandad (Lennard Pearce).[4] Their
      mother, Joan, died when Rodney was young, and their father Reg absconded
      soon afterwards, so Del became Rodney's surrogate father and the family
      patriarch. Despite the difference in age, personality and outlook, the
      brothers share a constant bond throughout.[5] The situation focuses mainly
      on their attempts to become <em> through questionable
      get-rich-quick schemes</em> and by buying and selling poor-quality and illegal
      goods. They have a three-wheeled Reliant Regal van and trade under the
      name of <mark> Independent Traders</mark>, mainly on the black market.[5]
      Initially, Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad were the only regulars, along with
      the occasional appearances of road sweeper Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) and
      pretentious used car salesman Boycie (John Challis). Over time, the cast
      expanded, mostly in the form of regulars at the local pub The Nag's Head.
      These included pub landlord Mike Fisher (Kenneth MacDonald), lorry driver
      Denzil (Paul Barber), youthful spiv Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray) and
      Boycie's flirtatious wife Marlene (Sue Holderness).[5] After Grandad died
      following the death of actor Lennard Pearce, his younger brother Uncle
      Albert (Buster Merryfield) emerged and moved in with Del and Rodney,
      becoming a main character.[4] The plots of many early episodes were
      primarily self-contained, with few plot lines mentioned again, but the
      show developed a story arc and an ongoing episodic dimension in later
      series. Del and Rodney's quest for love is a recurring theme, which
      eventually resulted in them finding long-term love in the form of Raquel
      (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong) respectively; Del also
      has a son with Raquel, Damien (played by five actors, most recently Ben
      Smith). The Trotters finally become millionaires, lose their fortune, and
      then regain some of it.[6] Derek "Del Boy" Trotter (played by David
